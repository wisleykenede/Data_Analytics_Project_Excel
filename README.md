# My Excel Data Analytics Projects  
 This repo contains two projects that I did on Data Science using Excel. For both projects I used a small portion of the dataset of the app [datanerd.tech](datanerd.tech) made by [Luke Barousse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/), that contains approximately 32000 job postings from 2023. You can find the dataset itself on the [Dataset](Resources/Dataset) folder of this repo.

## Salary Dashboard  
 This dashboard was created to serve as guidance for job seekers to investigate salaries for several Data Science jobs in several contries.

## Salary and Skills Analysis
 Following the same idea of helping job seekers from the first project, this time I focused more on the skills required in the job postings of the same [dataset](Resources/Dataset), to find what are the most popular skills among diferents jobs and which of them have the highest pay.
