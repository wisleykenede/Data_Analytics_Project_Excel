# Job Postings Dataset

 [`data_jobs_salary_all.xlsx`](data_jobs_salary_all.xlsx)

 For both projects, I used a small portion of the dataset of the app [datanerd.tech](datanerd.tech) made by [Luke Barousse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/), that contains approximately 32000 job postings from 2023. More precisely, it contains real-world data science job detailed information on:

 - 👨‍💼 Job titles
 - 💰 Salaries
 - 📍 Locations
 - 🛠️ Skills
